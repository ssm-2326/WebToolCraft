            <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>In today’s digital world, writing has become an important part of our daily life. Whether you are a
                student preparing an essay, a blogger creating SEO-friendly articles, or a professional writing emails
                and reports, keeping track of your words is essential.
            </p>
            <p>Word and character limits matter because every platform has its own restrictions. For example, social
                media platforms like Twitter allow only a fixed number of characters, while blog posts often require a
                minimum word count to rank better on search engines. Similarly, college assignments and professional
                documents usually come with specific word limits that must be followed.
            </p>

            <p>This is where a Word Counter Tool becomes very useful. It helps you check your word and character count
                instantly, saving time and ensuring that your writing stays within the required limits.
            </p>


            <!-- Section 1 -->
            <h2>What is a Word Counter Tool?</h2>
            <p>A Word Counter Tool is a free online tool that helps you quickly check the number of words, characters,
                sentences, and even spaces in any text. Instead of counting manually, which can be slow and inaccurate,
                this tool gives you the result instantly with just a single click or paste.</p>

            <p>The Word Counter Tool works in a very simple way. You just need to type or paste your text into the input
                box, and the tool will automatically calculate:</p>
            <p>
                <li>Total number of words</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Total number of characters (with and without spaces)</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Number of sentences and paragraphs</li>
            </p>

            <p>This makes the Word Counter Tool extremely useful for students, bloggers, writers, and professionals who
                want fast and accurate results while writing.</p>



            <!-- Section 2 -->
            <h2>How Does the Word Counter Tool Work?</h2>
            <p>The Word Counter Tool works in a very simple yet powerful way. It follows three basic steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input –</strong>First, you type or paste your content into the text box of the tool.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing –</strong> The tool’s algorithm instantly scans your text and counts the words,
                    characters, sentences, and spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Result –</strong>Within seconds, you get an accurate report showing the total word count,
                    character count (with and without spaces), sentence count, and paragraph count.</li>
                <p>One of the best features of the Word Counter Tool is real-time counting. This means as soon as you
                    start typing, the tool automatically updates the count. You don’t need to press any extra button –
                    the results appear instantly, saving both time and effort.</p>
            </ul>

            <!-- Section 3 -->
            <h2>Benefits of Using a Word Counter Tool</h2>
            <p>The Word Counter Tool is not just about counting words; it is a practical solution for different types of
                users. Whether you are a student, blogger, writer, or social media manager, this tool makes your work
                faster and more accurate.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ For Students – Assignments, Essays, Exams</li>
                <p>Students often have to write essays, reports, and assignments within a fixed word limit. With the
                    Word Counter Tool, they can make sure their work meets the required length without going under or
                    over the limit.</p>

                <li>For Bloggers – SEO-Friendly Word Limits</li>
                <p>Bloggers and content creators need to maintain a balance between readability and SEO. A Word Counter
                    Tool helps them track the word count while writing blog posts, ensuring that the content is long
                    enough to rank but not unnecessarily lengthy.</p>

                <li>For Writers – Accurate Word Count for Publishing</li>
                <p>Professional writers, authors, and freelancers often have to follow strict word counts when
                    submitting articles, stories, or eBooks. The Word Counter Tool provides an exact count, which is
                    essential for publishing and client requirements.</p>

                <li>For Social Media Users – Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn Post Limits</li>
                <p>Every social media platform comes with its own character and word restrictions. For example, Twitter
                    has a character limit, and LinkedIn posts work better within specific lengths. A Word Counter Tool
                    helps users write engaging posts while staying within these limits.</p>

            </ul>
